- **Factories**: Use models from [`database/factories`](md:database/factories) to generate fixtures.

### Common Commands

```bash
# Build the workbench app (required before running tests)
vendor/bin/testbench workbench:build

# Run the package test suite via Testbench
vendor/bin/testbench package:test

# Or use composer script if available
composer run test
```

## Static Analysis and Quality
